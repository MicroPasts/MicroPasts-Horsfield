                    The application is really simple. It loads a photo from 
                    our <a href="http://flickr.com/micropasts">Flickr feed</a> and asks 
                    you to <strong>tag all the elements that you recognise</strong>. 
                    These can be anything from 'objects' such as a <i>column</i> 
                    or a <i>camel</i>, an activity taking place such as 
                    <i>agriculture</i> or <i>transport</i>, a certain cultural 
                    group of people such as <i>Bedouin</i> or <i>European</i>, 
                    and/or more general themes such as simply <i>architecture</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You then hover the mouse over the elements that you identify, 
                    and then by clicking and dragging you will draw a box. 
                    A text box will appear, in which you will be able to type the 
                    name of that element and save it.
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    You can do this as many times as you want. If you wish to 
                    edit a tag or delete it altogether, you can do this by 
                    hovering over the relevant box, and then selecting either 
                    the pencil tool for editing, or the 'x' for deleting.
                </p>

             <div id="1" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
                <p>
                    If the photo has a caption, please try to transcribe it as
                    accurately as possibly into the transcribe label box.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As you can see, you have four buttons representing four 
                    categories of suggested keywords: Activity, Object, Theme and 
                    Cultural Group. Click on each one of these will bring up a 
                    list of suggested keywords to be used in tagging. 
                    You can refer to these lists when tagging each photo, 
                    but you can also add your own tags. Under the photo you will 
                    find a text box in which you can add any comments you might 
                    have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We would also like your help to give the photograph coordinates
                    and a Pleiades Identifier. If you go to the geo-code section on the right 
                    hand side and type a place name (refer to mapping hints for help)
                    you can select the place depicted in the photo. Once you have 
                    done this, try choosing a Pleiades identifier from the drop down list 
                    below.
