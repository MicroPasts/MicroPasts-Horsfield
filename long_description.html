        This application will help Rachael Sparks, keeper of UCL Institute of Archaeology's Collections, to get more information on some fascinating historical photographs from the Horsfield collection.

        George and Agnes Horsfield worked at archaeological sites mainly in Jordan in the 1920s and 1930s. Their projects included their magnificent Petra excavations, as well as works at the citadel in Amman and Jerash. Their photographic collection ended up at UCL's Special Collections facility, and includes thousands of photographs and negatives.

        Enhancing this important photographic archive will facilitate the searching of specific themes such as people, objects, architectural aspects, archaeological elements, etc.

        This application loads a picture from the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/micropasts/sets/72157644964279123/">Horsfield Archive</a> and asks people to tag identified people or elements. The user can click on the picture and drag to draw a rectangle on top of the element. This action will open a window where the user will be able to type the name of that element and save it.
