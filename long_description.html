          This application will help <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums/about/our-staff/sparks">Dr. Rachael Sparks</a>, Keeper of UCL Institute of Archaeology's Collections, to get more information on some fascinating historical photographs from the Horsfield collection. 
        </p>

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Horsfield">George</a> and Agnes Horsfield worked at archaeological sites mainly in Jordan in the 1920s and 1930s. Their projects included their magnificent Petra excavations, as well as works at the citadel in Amman and Jerash.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their photographic collection ended up at UCL's Special Collections facility, and includes thousands of photographs and negatives. Photos included in this application are from George's travels and excavations, and include sites in Jordan, Palestine, Israel, and Syria.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enhancing this important photographic archive will facilitate the searching of specific themes such as people, objects, architectural aspects, archaeological elements, etc.

            This application loads a picture from the 
            <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/micropasts/sets/72157644964279123/">Horsfield Archive</a> and asks people to tag identified people or elements. You can click on the picture and drag to draw a rectangle on top of the element. This action will open a window where you will be able to type the name of that element and save it. You can then add various keywords, attribute the place to a Pleiades identifier and geo-reference the photograph to a map.
