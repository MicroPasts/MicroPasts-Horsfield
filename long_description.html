            This application will help <a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums/about/our-staff/sparks">Dr. Rachael Sparks</a>, 
            Keeper of UCL Institute of Archaeology's Collections, to get more information on some fascinating historical
            photographs from the Horsfield collection. 
        </p>   
        <p>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Horsfield">George</a> and 
            <a href="http://trowelblazers.com/agnes-conway-horsfield/">Agnes</a> Horsfield worked at archaeological sites
            mainly in Jordan in the 1920s and 1930s. Their projects included their magnificent Petra excavations, as
            well as works at the citadel in Amman and Jerash.
        </p>
        <p>
            Their photographic collection ended up at UCL's Special Collections facility, and includes thousands of 
            photographs and negatives. Photos included in this application are from George and Agnes' travels 
            and represent George Horsfield's work as Chief Curator of Antiquities in Transjordan, and include sites in Jordan, 
            Palestine, Israel, and Syria. Many of these were taken by Agnes, and one of the included photos is of her, taken 
            with her own camera by George.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enhancing this important photographic archive will facilitate the searching of specific themes such as people, 
            objects, architectural aspects, archaeological elements, etc.
        </p>

            This application loads a picture from the 
            <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/micropasts/sets/72157644964279123/">Horsfield Archive</a> and asks people 
            to tag identified people or elements. You can click on the picture and drag to draw a rectangle on top of the 
            element. This action will open a window where you will be able to type the name of that element and save it. 
            You can then add various keywords, attribute the place to a Pleiades identifier and geo-reference the photograph
            to a map.
